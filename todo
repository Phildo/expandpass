- unicode
- validate smartly (know to skip whole groups of modifications/etc... if guaranteed to not succeed)
- --unroll #: notice if subgroup is something complicated, but results in < #(~100) possibilities, and expand to enumerated group (quicker runtime(?))
- parallelize (currently not super necessary- ~1M lines/s)
- user defined modification gamuts (for easy reuse)
- pre-defined modification gamuts (alpha, alphanumeric, etc...)
